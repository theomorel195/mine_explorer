![ROS 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS2-Humble-green)

## Overview
This repository is a meta-package containing all the components required to control and simulate the **Universal Robots UR5e** for the Mine Explorer project. Its primary goal is to provide a modular framework for landmine detection and neutralization.

The project is structured to separate physical description, simulation parameters, hardware communication, and high-level motion planning.



## Repository Structure

| Package | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `arm_mine_explorer_description` | ✅ Done | URDF/Xacro models, visual meshes, and kinematic chain. |
| `arm_mine_explorer_gazebo` | ✅ Done | Gazebo simulation setup, worlds, and ros2_control integration. |
| `arm_mine_explorer_controllers` | 🛠️ Planned | Specific controller configurations (Position/Velocity/Effort/Hybrid/...). |
| `arm_mine_explorer_hardware_interface` | 🛠️ Planned | Custom hardware abstraction layer for real-world operation. |
| `arm_mine_explorer_moveit2_config` | 🛠️ Planned | MoveIt 2 configuration for path planning and obstacle avoidance. |


## Quick Start

To visualize the arm model:

```bash
ros2 launch arm_mine_explorer_description display.launch.py
```

To run the simulationin Gazebo:
```bash
ros2 launch arm_mine_explorer_gazebo gazebo.launch.py
```

## Quality Assurance & Testing

Each package in this repository includes its own suite of tests (Linters and Integration tests). 
You can run the full test suite for the entire project to ensure everything is correctly installed and configured:

```bash
# Run tests for all packages in the project
colcon test --packages-up-to arm_mine_explorer --event-handlers console_cohesion+

# Check the overall summary
colcon test-result --all --verbose
```
